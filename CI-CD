CI- Continous Integration
CD- Continoud Delivery
CI is a process where u integrate set of tools or proecess that u folow before deliverying app to customer
CD -- delivery is a process hwere you deploy or deliver app on specific app to customer
unit test --- testing the specific block ofcode /functionality working or not 
static code analysis -- syntax, indentation, 
code quality/vulnerability checking --checking if it has chance of hack or something
Automation testing -- checking the new code/functionality doesnot impact anthing
report ---- result of test, quality check
Deployment -- where customer can able to access the app

V1 code --> pushed t git hub <-Jenkins will take the git hub code  ---> CI/CD(Jenkins tool)-->above all process([included with maven/Junit][SONAR][ALM/Reporting tool][K&S/Docker/Ec2])
                                                    Jenkins will act as a orchestarr or pipeline/tunnel
Jenkins pipleline: A set of steps that tells Jenkins what to do automatically
Jenkins works like this:

One main Jenkins server (called master)
Many machines connected to it (workers)

So here Jenkins also promote the application to diff env like Dev, Stage, prod one after the other
Dev-- In dev env the application can be tested in dimple EC2 instance. once everything is good using automatic/Manual approval moved to staging. IT MIGHT have 1 master/ 1node
Stating -- it have a cluster of EC2. 3m 5 nodes
prod --3/30n




CI/CD PIPELINES – MODERN THEORETICAL NOTES

(Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Containers, Kubernetes)

1️⃣ Why CI/CD Pipelines Are Important (Theory)

In traditional software delivery, applications were developed for months and then released together. This caused:

Late bug detection

Long release cycles

High risk during deployment

CI/CD was introduced to automate the entire delivery process, so that:

Every code change is tested

Applications are delivered within minutes or hours

Human intervention is minimized

Without CI/CD, software delivery becomes slow, unreliable, and error-prone.

2️⃣ What Is a Pipeline (Theoretical Definition)

A pipeline is a series of automated steps executed in a defined order to:

Build the application

Test the application

Package the application

Deploy the application

In Jenkins terminology, this automation is called a Jenkins Pipeline.
In GitHub, the same concept is implemented using GitHub Actions.

3️⃣ Jenkins Pipelines – Theoretical Understanding

Jenkins pipeline acts as an orchestrator that:

Integrates multiple tools (Git, Maven, Sonar, Docker, Kubernetes)

Executes each tool in a defined sequence

Stops the process if any step fails

Jenkins itself does not build code or deploy applications.
It coordinates tools that perform these actions.

4️⃣ Why Jenkins Becomes a Problem at Scale (Theory)

Jenkins follows a server-based architecture:

One Jenkins master (controller)

Multiple worker nodes (agents)

Problems at large scale:

Jenkins servers must always be running

Even when no code changes happen, servers consume CPU and RAM

For microservices (100s or 1000s of apps), this becomes costly

Maintenance overhead increases

Hence, Jenkins is considered a legacy CI/CD tool for large-scale modern systems.

5️⃣ Modern CI/CD – GitHub Actions (Theory)

GitHub Actions is a cloud-native CI/CD system built into GitHub.

The key difference:

Jenkins → always-on servers

GitHub Actions → runs only when code changes

GitHub Actions follows an event-driven model:

Code commit

Pull request

Merge

When an event occurs, GitHub automatically executes a pipeline.

6️⃣ What Happens AFTER Code Is Committed (DEEP FLOW)

This is the most important part.

Step 1: Code Commit

A developer commits code to a GitHub repository.

This commit generates an event inside GitHub.

Step 2: GitHub Detects the Event

GitHub continuously listens for events such as:

Push

Pull Request

Merge

Once detected:

GitHub checks for a workflow file (.github/workflows/*.yml)

This file defines:

What steps to run

In what order

Step 3: GitHub Creates a Runner (Container)

GitHub now needs a machine to run the pipeline.

Instead of using permanent servers:

GitHub creates a temporary container or virtual environment

This container is called a runner

This runner:

Has OS + tools

Exists only for the pipeline duration

Step 4: Pipeline Runs Inside the Container

Inside this container:

Code is checked out

Build tools run

Tests are executed

Docker images may be created

If pipeline fails:

Container is destroyed

No resources wasted

Step 5: Kubernetes Takes Over (If Used)

In advanced setups:

The runner itself runs as a Kubernetes Pod

Kubernetes schedules this pod on a worker node

Kubernetes responsibilities:

Decides where the pod runs

Allocates CPU and memory

Destroys pod after completion

7️⃣ Kubernetes Role in CI/CD (Theory)

Kubernetes acts as a resource manager.

It ensures:

No idle servers

High scalability

Efficient resource utilization

Instead of dedicating one server per project:

Kubernetes shares infrastructure

Multiple pipelines run as pods

8️⃣ VERY IMPORTANT: What Is a Pod (DETAILED)
Theoretical Definition

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.

It represents:

One running application

Or one CI/CD task

What a Pod Contains

One or more containers

Shared network

Shared storage

Containers inside a pod:

Always run together

Share IP address

Communicate via localhost

Why Pods Exist (Theory)

Kubernetes does not manage containers directly.
It manages pods, which provide:
Logical grouping
Resource sharing
Lifecycle management
Real-Life Understanding

Think of:
Container → individual worker
Pod → team working together
Node → office building

9️⃣ Worker Node and Master Node (Simple Theory)
Master Node:
Brain of Kubernetes
Makes decisions
Schedules pods

Worker Node:
Runs pods
Executes applications
Provides CPU and memory

MODEL 1: GITHUB ACTIONS (NO KUBERNETES NEEDED)

This is the most common and simplest model.

Flow (100% Correct & Simple)
Developer commits code
        ↓
GitHub detects commit
        ↓
GitHub Actions workflow starts
        ↓
GitHub creates a temporary runner (VM/container)
        ↓
Runner executes build / test / deploy
        ↓
Runner is destroyed
        ↓
Resources freed

MODEL 2: KUBERNETES-BASED CI/CD (CORRECT & COMPLETE)
Pod is created by Kubernetes
Container is created by container runtime

This model assumes:
👉 You already have a Kubernetes cluster
Developer commits code to GitHub
        ↓
GitHub detects the commit event
        ↓
CI tool is triggered (Webhook from GitHub)
        ↓
CI tool requests Kubernetes to run a job
        ↓
Kubernetes master schedules a pod
        ↓
Pod is created on a worker node
        ↓
Pipeline steps run inside the pod
        ↓
Pod is deleted after completion
        ↓
Worker node resources freed

Cluster
 ├── Master Node
 └── Worker Nodes
        └── Pods
             └── Containers
What is a Node? (Master & Worker)
Node = A machine (VM or physical server)

Runs Linux

Has CPU, RAM, Disk

Can be an EC2 instance

1️⃣1️⃣ Why This Architecture Is Powerful (Theory)
No idle infrastructure
High scalability
Cost-efficient
Cloud-native
Suitable for microservices

1️⃣2️⃣ Interview-Ready Summary (IMPORTANT)

Modern CI/CD systems use event-driven pipelines that create temporary containers or Kubernetes pods to execute builds and tests, 
ensuring zero resource wastage and high scalability.

A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes and can contain one or more containers.
Kubernetes uses pods instead of running containers directly because pods provide shared networking and storage, group containers that must work together, and allow Kubernetes to manage container lifecycles efficiently.
This abstraction simplifies scheduling, scaling, and operational management of containers in a cluster.
